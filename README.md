# Hi!

This is my test app for Falcon social, done in Angular, d3,js and Node.js and solving the problems specified in the e-mail sent.

As you'll notice, it was done with socket.io, express.js and less-middleware node plugins, with less being rendered on the server. I could have removed the node_modules dir on commits but I kept them here to serve as reminders of the node modules that are in the app.

The specified pages are actually tabs, and for the create/edit part I did a pop-up with a custom directive, to allow it to be closed just by clicking outside it. The publishing form has no validation, but empty items will be ignored when sent. The reach data fields are just checked for existence when sent and are in the input-number format, so in most modern browsers numbers are required on it.

In case of any doubts, feel free to contact me! Cheers!
Marcos
